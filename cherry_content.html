    <h3>Cherry</h3>
    <p>A cherry blossom is a flower of many trees of genus Prunus or Prunus subg. Cerasus. They are known as yinghua (櫻花) in Chinese and Japanese cherry and sakura (桜 or 櫻; さくら or サクラ) in Japanese. They are also a common species in East Asia, including China, Korea, and especially in Japan. They generally refer to ornamental cherry trees, not to be confused with cherry trees that produce fruit for eating.[4][5] It is considered the national flower of Japan.[6]</p>
